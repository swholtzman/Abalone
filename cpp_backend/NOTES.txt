2. Generating All Legal Next‐Ply Moves
2.1 Overall Steps
Identify which player (black or white) is to move.
Find lines of 1–3 of that color. (Inline or broadside in your problem doc are still the same logic: a line of up to 3 contiguous marbles, or a side step group of up to 3.)
For each such group, check each of the 6 directions (W, E, NW, NE, SW, SE) to see if a move is legal:
If it’s an inline push (the move direction is parallel to the alignment of those marbles):
Possibly push the opponent’s marbles, check if we can push them off the board, etc.
If it’s broadside/side step (the direction is perpendicular to the alignment):
Ensure all target cells are empty (or handle push rules if you do side‐push).
If legal, record the resulting board as a new configuration.
