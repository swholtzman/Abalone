# Abalone Game

An interactive implementation of the **Abalone board game** with an AI opponent designed using heuristic-based strategies. Built using a hybrid of **C++** for performance-critical simulation and **Python (PyQt5)** for a sleek graphical user interface.

---

## üß† Introduction

This project blends the strategic gameplay of Abalone with artificial intelligence to explore optimized gameplay through heuristic search and decision-making algorithms. It's a cross-platform solution aimed at showcasing AI implementation in board games using modern tools like `pybind11`, `CMake`, and `Nuitka`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### macOS

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Make sure you have:
   - Python 3.12
   - `clang++` or `g++`
   - `CMake`

2. **Run Setup Script**
   ```bash
   ./setup_and_run.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Create a fresh virtual environment
   - Install Python dependencies
   - Build the C++ backend
   - Launch the GUI

---

### Windows

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the following in **elevated PowerShell**:
   ```powershell
   .\install_dependencies.ps1
   ```

   Or manually via Chocolatey:
   ```powershell
   choco install python --version=3.12.0 -y
   choco install mingw -y
   choco install cmake -y
   ```

2. **Run Setup Script**
   ```powershell
   .\setup_and_run.ps1
   ```

   This will:
   - Set up virtual environment
   - Install Python packages
   - Compile C++ with MinGW
   - Copy required DLLs and modules
   - Launch the GUI

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Running the Game

- **macOS**: After `setup_and_run.sh`, the GUI starts automatically.
- **Windows**: After `setup_and_run.ps1`, the GUI starts. If using Nuitka, launch from the distribution folder.

---

### Simulating a Game (C++ Simulation)

1. Navigate to `cpp_backend/`

2. **Build the simulation:**

Using `make`:
```bash
make all
```
or
```bash
make play_game
```

Without Make:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 play_game.cpp Board.cpp TranspositionTable.cpp AbaloneAI.cpp -o play_game
```

3. **Run the Simulation:**
```bash
./play_game
```

> Output files like `moves_made.txt` and `visualize_output.txt` will be generated.

---

## üì¶ Packaging (Windows)

To create a distributable version using Nuitka:

```powershell
.build_with_nuitka.ps1
```

This script:
- Compiles the Python frontend
- Bundles resources from `public/`
- Creates a folder-based distribution

> üîÅ Ensure your game reads resources relative to the distribution structure (e.g., `../public`).

---

## üî¨ AI Strategy Enhancements

Additional research and strategy work are maintained in the `revisionWorktree/` directory. It includes:
- Refined AI logic with mobility and positional awareness
- Experimental improvements not yet merged into main `cpp_backend`

---

## üß© Troubleshooting

- **Missing DLLs on Windows?** Make sure MinGW and Python DLLs are copied to the GUI folder.
- **GUI not launching?** Check that PyQt5 and other packages are installed in your virtual environment.
- **Python version mismatch?** Windows users should use **Python 3.12**, not 3.13, to avoid MinGW issues.
